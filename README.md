### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sierra. I'm a young professional based in Boston, Mass. 

Pronouns: She/Her

I'm currently working on building my own portfolio website and using Google Analytics to examine web traffic. I'm a writer and content specialist, as well as a beginner in code, so I thought this would be a great way to continue learning. I have experience with C++ and HTML.
